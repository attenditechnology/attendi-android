/**
 * A plugin for [AttendiMicrophone] that plays audible notification sounds when recording starts and stops.
 *
 * This plugin uses [MediaPlayer] to play short audio cues:
 * - A **start** sound is played before recording begins, with a brief delay to ensure the sound isn't recorded.
 * - A **stop** sound is played immediately after recording ends.
 *
 * The start sound playback is **awaited** before recording starts, to avoid capturing the sound itself in the recording.
 * A timeout of 2000ms ensures the app doesn't hang indefinitely if playback fails or doesn't complete.
 *
